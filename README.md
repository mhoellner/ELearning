# E-Learning@HWR
Hello,<br>
this is the repository for our software project in our Software Engineering class at [Berlin School of Economics and Law](http://www.hwr-berlin.de/en) ([BSEL](http://www.hwr-berlin.de/en)) also known as [Hochschule für Wirtschaft und Recht Berlin](http://www.hwr-berlin.de) ([HWR](http://www.hwr-berlin.de)), department of cooperative studies, bachelor of Science in Computer Science.<br>
This is a customized [Umbraco](http://umbraco.com/) installation functioning as a prototype.<br>
We are using the JavaScript and CSS-Styling from our Learning Management System [Moodle](http://moodle.hwr-berlin.de), so all credits to them.<br>
Since it is a prototype, we probably won't fix a lot of bugs. It is just for having a general idea what our E-Learning platform could look like.<br>
This is a project by Katja Holzinger([@missymond](https://github.com/missymond)), Maximilian Prohl([@prohli](https://github.com/prohli)) and me, Milan Höllner([@mhoellner](https://github.com/mhoellner)).
